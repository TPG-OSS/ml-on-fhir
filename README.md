## Install the hapi fhir command line interface
Use the `hapi-fhir-cli` to deploy an empty FHIR server locally. Install the command line tool via the instructions on the [project page](http://hapifhir.io/doc_cli.html) or for Mac users:
```
$ brew install hapi-fhir-cli
```
After installation try
```
$ hapi-fhir-cli
```
to see if the command line tool was properly installed.
